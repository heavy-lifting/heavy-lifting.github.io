Hi folks

Just a quick note with some actual news - upcoming shows and stuff. I actually wrote a thoughtful and reflective letter a few months ago but then lost it all and gave up on re-writing it. Sorry about that. 

* Me and Loz FINALLY finished the TRVE YORKSHIRE KVLT ENSMBLE _SVLF TVTLVD_ tape - you can buy it for Â£6.66 via [don't drone alone](https://dontdronealone.bandcamp.com/album/svlf-tvtlvd)

* Unfortunately the amazing DINA are closing their doors :( I'm genuinely gutted about this as they have been such an important part of the Sheffield scene over the last decade, and personally they have provided me with so much space and support to develop heavy lifting and SONA activities. They are having one last hurrah on 21st July, me and Alex will be playing as epiploke along with other DINA regulars from over the years. More info available on the [DINA facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/dinavenue).

* I'm playing a show for fakedac at Wharf Chambers in Leeds on 25th August

* I'll be doing a slightly different from usual ambient set at [Bishop's House supporting Aiden Baker for Utility Tapes](https://bishopshouse.org.uk/event/aidan-baker-bleaklow-heavy-lifting/) - not many tickets left so book soon if you want to go to this (Bishop's House is one of the oldest buildings in Sheffield and very tiny, still can't get over the fact they let gigs happen there)

Hopefully next time I will say something more interesting :P 

Cheers

Lucy xx
