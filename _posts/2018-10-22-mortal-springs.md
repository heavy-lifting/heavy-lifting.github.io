soooooooooo i probably should have posted this a while ago but back in august i released an ep/mini album (it's an awkward length!) through [pan y rosas discos](http://www.panyrosasdiscos.net/).

it's called mortal springs and it's about persephone and demeter.  you can download it FOR FREE [here](http://www.panyrosasdiscos.net/pyr256-heavy-lifting-mortal-springs/)

it got some nice press in [the wire](https://i.postimg.cc/ZRx7rgVP/Dom-ZNMNW4-AAk-Z7y.jpg) and [we need no swords](https://weneednoswords.wordpress.com/2018/10/03/noise-triage-two/)

if you want to support me financially you can buy swish heavy lifting tshirts featuring my cat pablo for just FIVE POUNDS via [pickled discs](https://pickleddiscs.bandcamp.com/merch/heavy-lifting-t-shirts)

i know it sounds mushy but i'm super pleased with it and it's been so cool to have the support of keith at pan y rosas.  shout out to adam too for helping me record, mix and master at [tye die tapes](http://tyedietapes.com/)

catch me live soon in birmingham, osaka & tokyo xxx
