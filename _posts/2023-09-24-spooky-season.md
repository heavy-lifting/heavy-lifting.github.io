Hi folks

Some stuff I've been up to:

# gut level workshop

Me and Ray and Alex put on a relaxed beginner's Strudel workshop at Gut Level back in August as part of the Pattern Club event series. I've not really used Strudel before so that was fun, and I haven't done any workshops for a while, so that was fun too. The group had a really good atmosphere, I think at least in part thanks to the cosy vibes that Gut Level have established. We got pretty nice feedback and we're hoping to do a follow-up or maybe even to establish something regular again like the old Tidal Club meet ups.

# fakedac gig

I drove over to Leeds with Ray and Loz to play at Wharf Chambers (always a fun time) for fake[dac~]. For some reason I was excessively nervous about this gig, like I woke up in the morning and felt nervous, so the adrenaline rush was pretty intense. Once I'd played I felt good though, and really enjoyed the rest of the night. The other acts were super cool, especially Liimxa who I haven't seen before, and it was fun to hang out with live coding friends old and new <3

# aiden baker gig

Adam put on Aiden Baker and Bleaklow and me at super nice show at Bishop's House (the ?oldest? building in Sheffield? Or one of them at least...). I got to try out something different I've been wanting to experiment with for a while - I mic'ed up my keyboard and looped the keypresses with a bunch of field recordings I made mostly from my phone of sounds I liked this summer. We recorded it so it will hopefully get released at some point. I really enjoyed this set and felt like I got back a bit of the feeling of my very earliest live coding sets which were pure experimentation.

# spooky season

Seasons are turning over here in sheffield. I've moved to the top of a really big hill since this time last year and the weather is different up here

Traditionally I find the summer//autumn transition kind of a difficult time, I've never really pinpointed exactly why, but I think it probably stems back to the end of the summer holidays and having to go back to school, along with shortening days, rain, etc etc. This year I'm trying to cultivate a more positive attitude towards it, like looking forward to wearing my big coat, cosy evenings, football under floodlights etc. When I was younger I loved Halloween and all things spooky, and other seasonal delights like falling leaves and bonfire night. So I'm trying to lean into that positive nostalgia a bit. Luckily I have a silly band to channel that autumnal energy. Which brings me to...

# gigs

I'm doing a weird little pseudo tour this week, and got a couple of other shows booked in over the autumn:

28th Sept 2023 - epiploke @ Sidney and Matilda, Sheffield (algorave). Really looking forward to seeing Graham do his mechanical techno stuff again, and everything else on the lineup looks ace too. Me and Alex have been jamming quite a lot and the epiploke stuff is sounding really good (and weird)

29th Sept 2023 - TRVE YORKSHIRE KVLT ENSEMBLE @ Hatch, Sheffield (Strident Nights). 
We've made new costumes for our inevitable run of autumn/winter gigs (some bands just aren't for summer).

30th Sept 2023 - heavy lifting @ Palace Court Theatre, Bournemouth (not-yet-invented, mythic computation). Doing a sound recording/strudel workshop with Alex and then playing a lil algorave in the evening. Never been to Bournemouth but I'm hoping to swim in the sea.

13th Oct 2023 - TRVE YORKSHIRE KVLT ENSEMBLE @ Hatch, Sheffield. This is on FRIDAY THIRTEENTH and I'm very excited to play with Isis Moray :heart-eyes:

26th Oct 2023 - heavy lifting @ Mondrian Mansion, Sheffield. I'm supporting Sarah Heneghan on the Sheffield date of her Power Out tour - drums, electronics and lights! In a Mondrian themed mansion in Heeley! What's not to like?!

31st Oct 2023 - TRVE YORKSHIRE KVLT ENSEMBLE @ Wharf Chambers, Leeds (Heinous Whining). Back to Wharf for Halloween, hopefully they'll let us set off some smoke bombs.

I'm probably not going to book (m)any more gigs this year (famous last words) since my brother is having a baby soon and I'm going back to uni so I'll be travelling quite a bit for personal stuff over the next few months.

Oh also I found out I have high cholesterol so probs I'm gonna be eating plain beans next time u see me.

Ok, cool, bye
