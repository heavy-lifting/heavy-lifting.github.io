i've been attempting to work more with midi via tidal-midi so i can incorporate some outboard gear into my set, but i've been struggling with getting it up and running

you can read my attempts to document and troubleshoot this  <a href="http://ask.tidalcycles.org/question/212/problems-initialising-midi-in-windows-10/">here</a>

as part of <a href="https://www.shu.ac.uk/catalyst">catalyst festival</a> i organised a tidalcycles workshop for women run by <a href="http://cargocollective.com/tiemposdelruido/Alexandra-Cardenas">alexandra c√°rdenas</a>.  i discovered that me and her are the only women who perform with tidal, so i'm really hoping the workshop will support gender balance amongst users of the software.

yesterday i played a gig for audacious art experiment at picture house social in sheffield, which was super fun and a few people commented they enjoyed my set which was great!

watch this space for pics of the above events :)

i've got <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/296099617423371/">one upcoming show</a> at millennium gallery with loads of awesome performers from around the world as part of the algomech festival 2016, so excited for this one!  really hoping i get my set up sorted before then so i can hold my own amongst the big boys haha!
