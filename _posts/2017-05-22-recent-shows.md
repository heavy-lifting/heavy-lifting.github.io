i have been playing quite a lot of shows lately which has been super fun!

* leeds algorave - [CHECK OUT THE VIDEO HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dKn22kTW50)

   i did double duty at the recent leeds algorave performing first in collaboration with [qirky](https://qirky.github.io/) and laurie as TYPE using [foxdot](http://foxdot.org/) via [troop](https://github.com/Qirky/Troop).  ryan has been developing troop as an interface for collaborative live coding and it's a lot of fun.  later i did a solo set which i was a bit less psyched for and i didn't feel i gave my best performance which was a bit disappointing but it really doesn't matter cause all the other acts were awesome and the whole night was really fun, i didn't stop smiling!  only un-fun part was driving home at 3am but at least i had alex to keep me company.

   my secret shame is that i'm a eurovision megafan so just imagine my disappointment when the song contest was scheduled on the same night as newcastle algorave.  not to worry though as i brought europe to the tyne and used almost exclusively eurovision samples in my set.  i had fun!  we were also using a whole bunch of chemical data provided by the lab which i used for some weirdness in my parameters.  i didn't get to see many of the other acts as i was sitting on the door for a lot of the night, but i caught a little bit of qirky, [calum gunn](http://www.calumgunn.com/) and livedog who all performed extremely chemical sets. the venue was awesome and i love newcastle.  another fun night!

* sheffield algorave - [CHECK OUT THE VIDEO HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY0b4BCmD2c)

   phew three algoraves in a row - almost too much fun.  again i was on the door so didn't catch many of the earlier sets but i did see a little bit of qirky, all of [polinski](https://twitter.com/polinski) and the final ever [algobabez](https://twitter.com/algobbz) set (sob).  i don't know what polinksi was doing but it sounded great - piano plus glitched out speedy drums.  algobabez was just 2 emotional - not sure how algorave will survive without them.  there were tons of people there which is great as we raised a lot of money for access space and i think quite a lot of people were new to algorave and seemed to be digging it which is great.  i used the eurovision samples plus some blood sport samples.  not sure how my set was as i couldn't hear that well and i haven't watched it back yet - people seemed to enjoy it though which makes me happy.  also my dad watched it on livestream and he was into it so i know i must have really made it now :P  oh yeh also nearly forgot but me and ryan did a little impromptu troop set at the beginning which was also super fun and i thought sounded decent considering we hadn't practiced and i'd forgotten how to use foxdot.

* not a gig

   i've also been jamming with [blood sport](https://en-gb.facebook.com/bloodsportband/) for our upcoming collaborative [shows](https://heavy-lifting.github.io/shows.html) which is me live coding and them playing actual real life instruments.  this has been such an interesting experience for me as i haven't really done anything like this before, but i'm really enjoying the experience, figuring out strategies for improvisation and how to structure a set.  it's made me realise how selfish i am usually when i'm playing haha so i'm learning how much space to leave and how to communicate my intentions which feels super positive to me.
   
ok bye!!!!!!!!!!
